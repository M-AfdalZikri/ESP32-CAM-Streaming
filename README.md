# ESP32-CAM-Streaming

## Description
The **ESP32CAM** device is an ESP32-based camera module that enables real-time video streaming via a Wi-Fi connection. There are two programs that can be run on this device, each offering different functionalities for monitoring through a web interface.

### Program 1: Real-Time Monitoring
The first program allows users to monitor video in real-time through a device connected to a Wi-Fi network, using a web browser that can access the ESP32CAM device's IP address. The main features of this program are:

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Users can view the video streamed by the camera live, without the need for additional hardware.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: The ESP32CAM is connected to a Wi-Fi network, allowing remote monitoring from any location with internet access.
- **Access via Web**: This program can only be accessed through a web browser by entering the ESP32CAM's IP address for live streaming.

### Program 2: Real-Time Monitoring with Camera Features
The second program offers all the features of the first program, but with additional camera controls and features to enhance the user experience. These additional features include:

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: As in the first program, users can monitor video live from the camera.
- **Camera Control**: Users can perform additional controls on the camera, such as adjusting orientation or lighting, if supported by the device.
- **Access via Web**: Like the first program, this program can only be accessed through a web browser by entering the ESP32CAM's IP address for streaming and camera controls.

### Benefits of Program 2:
- **Advanced Control**: Allows users to make more advanced adjustments to the camera.
- **Flexibility**: Provides more options to tailor the monitoring experience according to needs.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: This program offers a more interactive web interface, allowing users to access camera settings and gain greater control over the monitoring process.

## Applications
- **Home Security**: Helps monitor the state of a home or business in real-time with or without additional camera features.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Can be used for monitoring systems in remote locations, with or without camera control features.

## Technologies Used
- **ESP32CAM** for image processing and video streaming.
- **Wi-Fi** for connecting the device to the network and enabling streaming.
- **Web Interface** for monitoring and controlling the device through a browser.

## Installation and Usage
1. Install the ESP32CAM at the desired location.
2. Connect the ESP32CAM to the Wi-Fi network.
3. Choose the appropriate program for monitoring: Program one for basic viewing or Program two for utilizing additional camera features.
4. Access the real-time streaming through a web browser by entering the ESP32CAM's IP address in the URL.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding integration with mobile apps for more convenient monitoring.
- Adding AI features for object or face detection.
